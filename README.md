Introduction:

Netflix is a leading global streaming service, offering a vast collection of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and original productions. With a user-friendly interface and personalized recommendations, it has redefined how people consume entertainment. It have more than 83 million subscribers and presence in more than 190 countries. Its users watch around 130 million hours of TV and movie content daily. From binge-worthy series to blockbuster films, Netflix caters to diverse tastes, making it a go-to platform for millions worldwide.

Business Context

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.

In this project, you are required to do

Exploratory Data Analysis Understanding what type content is available in different countries If Netflix has been increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years. Clustering similar content by matching text-based features Dataset Description:
